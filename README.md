This project is a simple point-of-sale (POS) simulator inspired by the vibrant art style of the rhythm game **Muse Dash**. It was created as a hands-on activity for a **Computer Programming 2** course to practice building a multi-form application, managing application state, and handling user interface events in VB.NET.

The simulator allows users to browse and purchase official merchandise from the **Muse Dash peropero store**, with a special guest cashier appearance from the **Touhou Project**.

## Core Features üõí

-   **Browse Merchandise**: Users can navigate through different items in two separate shops using next and previous buttons.
-   **Two Separate Shops**: The application features a Badge Shop and a Keychain Shop, each with its own set of items based on official Muse Dash merchandise.
-   **Add to Cart**: A simple "Purchase/Buy" button allows users to add items to their virtual shopping cart, which updates the total cost in real-time.
-   **Dynamic Checkout Process**: A checkout screen summarizes the purchased items and their quantities, calculates the grand total, and prompts for payment.
-   **Payment Simulation**: The system accepts a payment amount, calculates the correct change, and provides feedback to the user).

## Technical Implementation üë®‚Äçüíª

-   **Language**: VB.NET (Windows Forms)
-   **Architecture**: The application is built using a multi-form structure to separate different views (Main Menu, Badge Shop, Keychain Shop, Checkout, etc.).
-   **State Management**: Data such as the total cost and individual item counts are passed between forms using public variables. This is a common method for managing state in smaller Windows Forms applications.
-   **Event-Driven UI**: All user interactions are managed through event handlers (e.g., `Button_Click`), which update the UI by dynamically changing `PictureBox` images and `Label` text content to create an interactive shopping experience.
